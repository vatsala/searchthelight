First Point to note is that in this world, we look at data transformation. In the OOP world we look at data encapsulation or data hiding. 

Heart of Functional Programming lies in the idea of transforming data. A function transforms its input into output. 
Which brings along with itself, a certain amount of unparalleled power.

In essence, programming, now is all about transforming data and not about hiding it behind models.
