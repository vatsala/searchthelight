First Point to note is that in this world, we look at data transformation. In the OOP world we look at data encapsulation or data hiding. 

Heart of Functional Programming lies in the idea of transforming data. A function transforms its input into output. 
Which brings along with itself, a certain amount of unparalleled power.

In essence, programming, now is all about transforming data and not about hiding it behind models.



Repeat after me - (straight away typed out of the book)
-----------------------------------
Object Orientation is not the only way to code.
Functional programming need not be complex or mathematical
The foundations of programming are not assignment, if statements and loops #mywholelifeisalie
Concurrency does not need locks,monitors,semaphores and the like
Processess are not necessarily expensive resources
Metaprogramming is not something that just gets tacked onto a language
Even if it is work, programming should be fun.



= is a match operator, not an assignment operator
