Instead of having 50 images of varying size and shape strewn all over your HTML page that will cause 50 downloads to the person accessing the page, 
think about having one single image, containing all these images, and using CSS to selectively mask out the portions and show the images relevant to that part of the HTML page.

This technique is called Sprites and is now(2013) an established practice in designing for the web

the relevant css for using this technique is -
background : url(<image_Name>) x-coord y-coord;

So you need to know the size and shape of the icons in your MEGA image for you to succeed in navigating around the image and showing only the relevant parts of the image.
